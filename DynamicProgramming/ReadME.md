#Dynamic Programming

1. A way of making algorithm more efficient by storing some intermediate results.
2. DP is breaking down the complex problem in to simple sub problems.
3. store the results of sub problems.
4. By using these, calculate the result for complex problem.


#Backtracking

Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique for finding all solutions to a computational problem 
that incrementally builds candidates for solutions and abandon a candidate("backtracks") as soon as it 
determines that the candidate cannot poddibly be completed to a valid solution.
